[[CV]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinnodinosaur/dinnodinosaur.github.io/main/contents/Junxian%20Li_CV.pdf)\
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Design at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Shijian Luo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0099094). My research focuses on creating immersive and multisensory experiences in Virtual Reality, with an emphasis on Interaction Design, User Experience, and Immersive Analytics. I am particularly interested in developing innovative ways to enhance sensory feedback, such as olfactory and tactile interactions, to bridge the gap between physical and digital environments. I aim to design intuitive interfaces that enable users to engage more naturally with complex data and virtual environments. My work spans experimental system development, user-centered design, and evaluating multisensory interfaces to explore how digital interactivity can be both enriching and intuitive.
